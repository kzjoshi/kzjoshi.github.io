# LIMS Data Quality Classifier

**Final Project – AOS C111/204**

This project builds a machine learning classifier to flag suspicious
quality-control (QC) records in a synthetic LIMS dataset, supporting
data integrity and ALCOA+ expectations in regulated environments.

## Problem
QC labs generate large volumes of assay data, but human review capacity
is limited.

## Data
Synthetic LIMS-like dataset (~2,000 records) with numeric assay results
and categorical metadata.

## Methods
RandomForest classifier with preprocessing pipeline.

## Results
Precision/recall, ROC-AUC, feature importance.

## Conclusion
Demonstrates how ML can prioritize QC review without replacing human judgment.
